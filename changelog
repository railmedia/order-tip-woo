== Changelog ==

= 1.5.2 =
*Released 4 February 2025*

* Added default options. Some options require default values for the correct workings of the plugin. Added *wc_order_tip_session_type* for the time being

= 1.5.1 =
*Released 2 February 2025*

* Added new option to select the type of session you would like to use for tip storage. On certain hosting platforms, such as Dreamhost, the usage of the PHPSESSID session, destroys the page cache and therefore, the shop should use WooCommerce only session, while on other hosters, you can use the PHP session as well.
